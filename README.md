# Challenge-2

## Abstract
Here I have uploaded my solution for the first Challenge of the Advanced Programming and Scientific Computing (PACS) course in Politecnico di Milano.
The main purpose of the challenge is to implement a program which compares the different performances of the Matrix-Vector product depending on the choice of matrix ordering (`ROW_ORDER` or `COL_ORDER`) and on the type of storage of the matrix inside the memory (Uncompressed (known as `COOmap`) or Compressed (depending on the order `CSR` or `CSC`).
