- README is clear, you forgot to write wath paths to change in the Makefile

- friend operators should be defined outside of the class

- avoid to inline definitons of long funcitons inside the class body

- good implementation of the valueType with concepts

- in operations that can't be executed on compressed matrices, you should give a warning

- initialize the default value when returning 0 in the const call operator

- use if constexpr when the checks can be done compile time

- you should not hard-code the matrix dimensions in the test but deduce them from the Matrix class

- I got a compile time error in the definition of the method Matrix::clear() due to the template arguments

- no gain in computational time 
 
- segmentation fault in Matrix::mat_resize() when the new matrix dimension is smaller than the previous
- add checks for matrix and vector dimension compatibility in the prodcut
